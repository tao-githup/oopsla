Installation instructions

1、download the tool. 
2、put the file quantum.py,param.txt and param1.txt in your home directory. 
    And run "chmod 777 quantum.py" BTW, param.txt is the matrix param for gorver search algorithm,
   and param1.txt is for phase estimation. When you switch to phase estimatin algorithm, 
   you need to change the file name param1.txt to param.txt.
